In May, [Jennifer Reif](https://jmhreif.com/) from [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) visited us with everything we needed to know about Graphs and Neo4j:

***Keeping up with database trends? Or learning for a project requirement? Or something else? In this session, we will hit the high points on graph databases and get Java developers what they need to get started quickly and successfully. From data model to applications, these are the Cliff Notes!***

Jennifers slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jmhreif/cliff-notes-what-java-developers-need-to-know-about-graph-databases).

Thanks so much to her for the very informative and entertaining evening!
