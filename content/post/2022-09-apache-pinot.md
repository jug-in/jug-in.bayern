title: Apache Pinot  - Realtime Analytics with Alexander Pucher
date: 2022-09-13

[Apache Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org/) enables user-facing analytics at scale. Pinot is a distributed database that reliably queries large datasets in milliseconds even while ingesting a firehose of realtime events. You typically find Pinot under hood of interactive apps & dashboards, anomaly detection use-cases, and company-internal data lakes.

[Alexander Pucher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexpucher/)  introduced Apache Pinot to us and we discussed common use-cases and solutions. Besides the getting started with Pinot, we will had the chance to ask Alex literally everything about it.

If you’re looking of a quick primer, here’s a short [Video Intro to Apache Pinot](https://youtu.be/_lqdfq2c9cQ) by our very own Tim Berglund @ [StarTree.ai](https://www.startree.ai/)

Alex's slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aikXzKtEujxd6qeas3qH281LAHsiZecdFczZQzG1peA/edit?usp=sharing), thank you for the great session.
