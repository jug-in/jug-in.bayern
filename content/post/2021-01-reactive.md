###  Julien Ponge (Red Hat)

At the first Java-Meetup in 2021 we welcomed **[Julien Ponge](https://julien.ponge.org)** who just published
his latest writing [Vert.x in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/vertx-in-action).

Alongside Vert.x, Julien is working on [SmallRye Mutiny](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/), the brand new reactive library with first class support in [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-reactive) working there in perfect harmony with Vert.x.

Julien worked and taught almost ten years at the [INSA in Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/) and works since quite a while at **Red Hat** on reactive topics around Java.

He stated out "It will be fun!" on our request to give us a talk about modern reactive developments with Java.
_And it was!_

Thank you Julien for that very good and comprehensive flight through reactive systems and reactive programming with Java.

**Julien provided us his slides, please find them [here as PDF](https://github.com/jug-in/jug-in.talks/raw/master/3rd/ingolstadt-jug-jan2021.pdf) and don't miss his reactive service mesh example at [Github](https://github.com/jponge/ingolstadt-jug-january-2021) as well as his Mutiny workshop code [here](https://github.com/jponge/mutiny-workshop-examples)**.
