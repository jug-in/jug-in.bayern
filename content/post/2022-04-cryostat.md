[Andrew Azores](https://github.com/andrewazores), [Chris Mah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahchristopher) came by with their Red Hat team to talk about [Cryostat](https://cryostat.io/), the Java Flight-Recorder Manager for Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Cryostat is a Kubernetes and OpenShift operator, enabling and automating the monitoring of JVM applications with JDK Flight recorder by using Kubernetes mechanisms.
For more details, you can have a look to [Andrews blog series about Cryostat](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/10/18/announcing-cryostat-20-jdk-flight-recorder-containers).

The slides the guys brought to us can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jug-in/jug-in.talks/raw/master/3rd/Cryostat_Demo_JUG_April_12.pdf).

Thanks so much to the whole Cryostat team for the great talk and of course the awesome product you're building!
