The Java-Treff in Oktober was very special to us:
We welcomed **Jakub Scholz**, who's working at Red Hat as a designated Kafka and messaging expert.

Jakub did not only introduce Kafka and its usage to us but also had a few words on his current project the Strimzi operator.

**Thank you a lot Jakub, was a great and comprehensive introduction to Kafka and Strimzi.**

The slides of Jakubs talks can be found [here](http://www.jsch.cz/jugingolstadt).
